Running through February 8, the Algolia Agent Studio Challenge invites you to build intelligent, data-driven AI agents using Algolia's Agent Studio and search infrastructure.

Whether you're crafting conversational shopping assistants, building smart workflow enhancements, or creating proactive user experiences, this challenge is your opportunity to explore how fast, contextual retrieval powers the next generation of AI applications.

There will be four chances to win.

We hope you give it a try!


**Challenge Prompts:**

**Consumer-Facing Conversational Experiences:**
    Craft rich, dialogue-based experiences for end users. Think shopping assistants, guided discovery tools, customer support bots, or any conversational interface that benefits from intelligent data retrieval.
    Your agent should demonstrate targeted prompting with retrieval from indexed data to provide contextually relevant responses. Consider incorporating Algolia's new InstantSearch chat widget to build your frontend experience.Use Agent Studio to craft rich, dialogue-based experiences for end users.

**Consumer-Facing Non-Conversational Experiences**

    Build smart enhancements that proactively assist users within existing workflows. We're looking for solutions that inject intelligence without requiring explicit conversation.
    Examples include:
        Solution suggestions from a knowledge base during support ticket submission
        Fashion "look" creation from a curated index
        PC building with knowledge of compatibility of different components
    The key is showing how contextual data retrieval enhances user experience without requiring back-and-forth dialogue.



**Judging Criteria:**
    Use of underlying technology
    Usability and User Experience
    Originality and Creativity





**In order to participate**, 
you will need to create an Algolia account and publish a post using the submission template associated with each prompt.
    Your project should integrate Algolia's Agent Studio and demonstrate how fast, relevant data retrieval enhances your AI agent's performance. All projects must be deployed and functional.
    Algolia's Free Build Plan provides everything you need to complete your project—no credit card required!
