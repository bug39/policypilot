Last updated: 2026-02-05
Current phase: spike (Day 0)
Next feature to work on: F01

===

SESSION 1 — 2026-02-05 (Day 0, Planning)

COMPLETED:
- Read hackathon brief (hackathon.md) and rough idea (rough_idea.md)
- Researched Algolia Agent Studio capabilities, API, tools, pricing
- Researched Algolia search/indexing features (filters, custom ranking, facets)
- Researched competitive landscape (~15+ existing submissions analyzed)
- Validated idea is technically feasible on Algolia Free Build plan
- Validated idea is novel (no conflict-resolution agents in current submissions)
- Wrote comprehensive SPEC.md covering architecture, UX, data model, scope
- Ran two independent audits (hackathon compliance + technical gaps)
- Fixed all FAIL/CRITICAL audit findings in SPEC.md v2:
  - Added submission template requirements (4 required dev.to sections)
  - Added judge-facing instructions plan
  - Defined complete PolicyRecord TypeScript schema
  - Defined XML structured output format with ParsedVerdict type
  - Locked API architecture (Next.js API route proxy)
  - Locked LLM provider (free GPT-4.1 dev, paid OpenAI prod)
  - Added all 6 UI states (empty, loading, success, error, timeout, parse failure)
  - Added anti-hallucination requirements
  - Added Algolia visibility elements
  - Replaced follow-up chat with batch analysis stretch goal
  - Added red herring policies
  - Shifted system prompt drafting to Day 0
- Created features.json v1 (20 features across 6 phases)
- Created init.sh and this progress file
- Ran feature list audit (third audit)
- Updated features.json v2 (23 features) addressing all critical/high findings:
  - Split F05 (system prompt tuning) into 3 sub-features: scenarios 1&2, 3&4, consistency pass
  - Added F09: TypeScript types + demo ticket data + mock parsed verdicts (foundation phase)
  - Added F12: Two-panel layout shell with state management and conditional rendering
  - Merged empty/onboarding state into layout shell (F12)
  - Added preconditions to F20 (integration) and F23 (submission)
  - Fixed F16→F19: timing label says "Analysis completed" not "Policies retrieved"
  - Added F07 step: save sample XML outputs as mock data for frontend
  - Added F07 step: begin submission post skeleton (submission-draft.md)
  - All verification steps now labeled Manual/Automated where appropriate
  - Added error-case testing to F11 (API route)
  - Added go/no-go decision criteria to F03

KEY DECISIONS:
- Track: Non-Conversational (less competitive, proactive workflow enhancement)
- No chat widget of any kind (weakens non-conversational positioning)
- XML tags for structured output (more reliable than section headers)
- Next.js API route proxy (keeps keys server-side, avoids CORS issues)
- policy_layer numeric field (1-4) for deterministic conflict resolution
- Temperature=0 for demo reliability

BLOCKED ON:
- Nothing. Ready to start spike (F01).

KEY RISKS IDENTIFIED:
- Multi-step retrieval may not work in Agent Studio (validate in F03)
- XML output parsing may be fragile (validate in F03)
- Day 1 is ~9-13 hours of work (system prompt iteration is biggest time sink)
- LLM rate limits during judging if using Gemini free tier (use paid OpenAI)

DISCOVERIES:
- Algolia provides free GPT-4.1 access for development
- Vercel AI SDK compatible via compatibilityMode=ai-sdk-5
- Agent Studio is in beta — docs may be incomplete
- Gemini free tier rate limits reduced to 5-15 RPM (tighter than expected)
- Previous hackathon winners were all non-obvious use cases

FILES IN REPO:
- SPEC.md — comprehensive project specification (source of truth)
- features.json — feature list with verification steps (coding agent contract)
- init.sh — dev environment boot script
- claude-progress.txt — this file
- hackathon.md — original hackathon brief
- rough_idea.md — original project idea

===

NEXT SESSION SHOULD:
1. Run init.sh to confirm environment
2. Read this file and features.json for context
3. Start feature F01: Create Algolia account, index, push test records
4. Then F02: Configure Agent Studio agent with system prompt v1
5. Then F03: Validate multi-step retrieval, XML output, response structure
