    <description>The General Return Policy (RET-1.1) would deny the return due to being outside the 30-day window, but the Shipping Damage Override Policy (DMG-4.1) approves the return because the damage was reported to the carrier within 48 hours.</description>

  <resolution>
    <winning_policy>DMG-4.1</winning_policy>
    <rule_applied>The Shipping Damage Override Policy (DMG-4.1) is a situational override (policy_layer 4), which takes precedence over the General Return Policy (policy_layer 1) and the product-specific warranty (policy_layer 3).</rule_applied>
  </resolution>

  <recommended_action>Process a full refund or replacement for the Alpine Pro Hiking Boots as per the Shipping Damage Override Policy. Ensure documentation of the carrier damage report is obtained from the customer.</recommended_action>
