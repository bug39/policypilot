    <description>The General Return Policy (RET-1.1) would, based on its time condition, potentially allow a return, but the In-Ear Audio Products Hygiene Override (HYG-4.1) specifically denies returns for opened in-ear audio products.</description>
  </conflict>

  <resolution>
    <winning_policy>HYG-4.1</winning_policy>
    <rule_applied>Situational overrides (policy_layer 4) always take precedence over general policies (policy_layer 1) when their conditions are met. HYG-4.1 is a layer 4 policy and applies directly to this situation.</rule_applied>
  </resolution>

  <recommended_action>Inform the customer that their return request is denied due to the hygiene policy for opened in-ear audio products. Explain that for health and hygiene reasons, opened in-ear audio products are final sale.</recommended_action>
