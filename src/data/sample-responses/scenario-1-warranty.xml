    <description>The General Return Policy (RET-1.1) would deny the return due to being outside the 30-day window, while the Pro-Treadmill X500 Motor Warranty (WAR-3.1) and the Defective Item Override Policy (DEF-4.1) would approve a resolution due to a product defect.</description>
  </conflict>

  <resolution>
    <winning_policy>DEF-4.1</winning_policy>
    <rule_applied>The Defective Item Override Policy (DEF-4.1) takes precedence as it is a situational override (policy_layer 4), which is the highest policy layer.</rule_applied>
  </resolution>

  <recommended_action>Arrange for the Pro-Treadmill X500 to be inspected by Apex Gear's quality team to confirm the motor defect. Upon confirmation, process a full refund for the customer as requested, or offer a replacement.</recommended_action>
